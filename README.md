# carve.io

territory carving local multiplayer board game inspired by splix.io

made for my AP microeconomics project

### How to play

- the goal is to claim the most tiles
- enclose an area to claim all the tiles inside it
- if you touch another player's head, the player will lose all progress and restart
- if you touch another player's tail, the player will lose their tail but not their claimed area
